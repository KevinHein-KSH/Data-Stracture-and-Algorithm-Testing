# DSA Testing (C / C++ Learning Repository)

This repository is my personal practice space for learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **C and C++**.  
It is **not** meant to be a full application — just experiments, small programs, and reference implementations while I study.

I am using the PDF *“Deep Dive Into DSA” by Win Htut (National Cyber City / GreenHackers Team)* as my main study material, and most exercises in this repo follow concepts from that book.

## Purpose

- Strengthen C and C++ fundamentals  
- Practice implementing classic data structures  
- Understand algorithms through hands-on coding  
- Improve memory-level understanding (pointers, allocation, value/reference behavior)

This repo is intentionally simple and beginner-friendly so I can iterate and improve as I progress.

## What’s Inside

The repository will grow over time. Currently it includes:

- Small C / C++ files for testing specific concepts  
- Implementations based on chapters from the PDF  
- Early experiments with:
  - Arrays & pointers  
  - Functions & recursion  
  - Structures & classes  
  - Linked lists, stacks, queues (upcoming)  
  - Sorting & searching (upcoming)

Some files may be incomplete or rough — this is a learning project.

## How to Build

Compile individual files as needed.

### Compile C files

```bash
gcc file.c -o program
./program
```

### Compile C++ files

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp -o program
./program
```
